3. Write a program that, given a graph with costs, does the following:
    verify if the corresponding graph is a DAG and performs a topological sorting of the activities using the algorithm based on depth-first traversal (Tarjan's           algorithm);
    if it is a DAG, finds a highest cost path between two given vertices, in O(m+n).
